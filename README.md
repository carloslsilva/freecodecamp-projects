# freeCodeCamp Projects

This app incorporates three projects from the freeCodeCamp Front-End
Development Libraries Curriculum, originally developed and showcased
on CodePen.

I have recently amalgamated and updated these projects into a Vite
project, developed using React, React Hooks, Redux, React Router, and
Tailwind CSS.

## Tools Used

- **Development Environment**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Library**: [React](https://react.dev/)
- **Routing**: [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- **State**: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## Run Locally

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carloslsilva/freecodecamp-projects
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
cd freecodecamp-projects
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

After that server should be running on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

> I am using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
